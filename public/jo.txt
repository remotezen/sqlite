              Welcome to Inspirational Eating. This blog is a place for me to share my passion for healthy plant-based eating. I utilize whole foods in a nutritious and delectable way.
              My philosophy concerning food is that we should eat for sustenance while ensuring a balance of nutrients and most importantly sensually satisfying.

              I struggled with seasonal allergies, digestive issues and food sensitivities for most of my life. I finally reached a point where I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. And so began my journey.

              The first undertaking was to determine what was aggravating my system. This led me to a holistic allergist. Once the offending irritants were identified, treated and eliminated my allergies and sensitivities vastly improved. A link to what I was eating or exposed to and how I felt became apparent. 

              The challenge then became, "Ok, I know what I shouldn't eat, so now what can I eat?"
              My research led me to incorporating more whole foods in my diet, in particular more vegetables. Vegetables is probably the one food group that all of us could be adding to our diet. This eventually resulted in my diet becoming almost exclusively plant-based.

              I easily lost some extra weight that I had been carrying for years. I gained energy, stamina and rarely got sick. My eagerness for this healthy way of eating led me to becoming a Culinary Nutritionist. 

              I am eager to share my enthusiasm for healthy eating with you.

              Sincerely, Joanne Hall
